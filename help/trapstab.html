    <h2>Traps Tab</h2>
    The properties of each trap are exposed in a spreadsheet.
    Each row corresponds to a trap, and each column to a property.
    Every trap has the following properties:
    <ul>
	<li><b>x</b>: the X position of the trap [pixels]</li>
	<li><b>y</b>: the Y position of the trap [pixels]</li>
	<li><b>z</b>: the Z position of the trap [pixels]</li>
	<li><b>A</b>: the relative amplitude of the trap</li>
	<li><b>ϕ</b>: the relative phase of the trap [radians]</li>
    </ul>
    These values update in real time as you manipulate the traps
    and can be edited directly by clicking on a cell.

    Additional columns are added automatically to control properties
    of structured traps. These extra columns are not labeled.
    Instead, the relevant cells have tooltips that explain their function.
